# OnionBitHash
Waiting for development...

//--------------------------------------//

OnionBitHash, it's kind a miner kind a rewarder at the same time.. You receive rewards in crypto by, participating in a small or large network that are mining for a middle man, when you complete a job, you will get rewarded, but, it has fees and that fees are the rewards for the middle man! It's decentralized, what I mean with "the middle man", is, you wall work for a middle man, in the end you get rewarded, with fees..
